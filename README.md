# Retinopathy_Classification_SRA_2023

A neural network using the ResNet-34 model that diagnoses and classifies retinopathy into 6 types. We tried to train our model to identify whether a patient has retinopathy, and then classify its type and severity, using supervised learning with a small neural network under 10 layers in size. We use only 2333 fundus scans, 1933 diagnosed with retinopathy and 400 without retinopathy, which are chosen from the Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) dataset. We tried to classify these images into six categories: mild nonproliferative diabetic, moderate nonproliferative diabetic, severe nonproliferative diabetic, hypertensive, proliferative diabetic, and no retinopathy.
